        <section><p>The marketing department wants to record all contacts ( telephone, mail, email,
                visits) in order to calculate the costs incurred for a customer. For each contact,
                the contact type, date, start time and end time, subject and any charges (e.g. to
                send a gift ) are tracked. If for example an employee has spend half an hour with a
                letter, then it must be possible to calculate later that the costs are 0.5 *
                $60.</p>To do this, create a new table named <userinput>Contacts</userinput> and
            link this to table <wintitle>Customers</wintitle> and enforce referential
            integrity.</section>

            <title>Solution</title>
            <p>Normally you should first do â€‹an information analysis. The result should be which
                fields are necessary in table Contacts, what will be the key and which relationships
                through which fields. Therefore multiple solutions are possible. One solution could
                be as displayed in the next figure:<fig>
                    <image keyref="ex_tabl009_contacts"/>
                </fig></p>Considerations for this design and other designs:<ul>
                <li>Several contacts of a customer should be recorded. Hence a key field
                        <varname>ContactID</varname> and the field <varname>CustomerCode</varname>
                    (data type: Number - Long Integer) providing a link with table
                        <wintitle>Customers</wintitle>.</li>
                <li>If table <wintitle>Employees</wintitle> is available, then it is so convenient
                    to be able to register which employee has handled the contact. In that case add
                        field<varname>EmployeeCode</varname> (data type: Number - Long Integer)
                    providing a link with table <varname>Employees</varname>.</li>
                <li>Information analysis should give you the values for field
                        <varname>ContactType</varname>. For this field you should create list box
                    with these values.</li>
                <li>For the three date / time fields a suitable format should be selected, possibly
                    with an input mask.</li>
                <li>Information analysis should tell you how the costs are calculated. The
                    processing time can be calculated from the start and end times, so it is process
                    data and should therefore not be included in the table. If the hourly rate is a
                    constant, then it can also be omitted from the table. In that case, there is
                    nothing about the costs included in the table and the cost are calculated in a
                    query or report. Varies the hourly rate or time, then the hourly rate should be
                    included in the table.</li>
            </ul>
